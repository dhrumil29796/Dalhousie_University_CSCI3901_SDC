## Final Project: Covid Tracker
Covid Tracker helps us manage the COVID-19 pandemic using contact tracing. When one person is diagnosed with COVID-19, the ability to notify other individuals who have been in contact with the person who is COVID-positive allows us to limit the spread of the disease faster. At the same time, the ability to use contact information to detect the frequency of large gatherings also helps us understand the communityâ€™s compliance with physical distancing advisories. Covid Tracker is a scaled-down functionality of the Canadian federal governmentâ€™s application for contact tracing.</br>
